# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `0 == True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `False == False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + True`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 9`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

## ðŸ’» Program
```python
a = (1 == True)

b = (1 == False)

c = True + 3

d = False + 7

print("a is True")
print("b is False")
print("c:",c)
print("d:",d)
```
## Output
![439861387-b01d2052-2ec2-4fc2-abd8-025753e6fd68](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61344a31-f1c5-4d0b-a30e-9846f7ba7521)


## Result
a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False is successful.
